# Administering Lambda\-based Applications<a name="admin-lambda-apps"></a>

AWS Lambda integrates with many of the administration tools that AWS offers, including AWS tagging, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS IAM\. The sections below offer guidance on how to manage your Lambda\-based applications, including organizing your Lambda based applications using tags, auditing activity on your AWS using CloudTrail, and introduce you to the AWS Security Model for how to secure your Lambda\-based applications\. We also discuss an administration task unique to AWS Lambda, which is managing the concurrent execution behavior of a Lambda function\.
